##### This is a port of the pypsdd library from python2 to python3.
##### It's not stable nor thoroughly tested, so take it's results so take its results with a pinch of salt.
##### As of now, tests comparing the generated tensorflow arithmetic circuits show that the two versions build the same network, however this is not enough and more testing is required.
###### Tests comparing the output tensorflow graphs from both versions (python2 and 3) can be found in 2to3testing.
